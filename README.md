# InfiniteCreations

In a world of polygons, create, shape, script and build a world never imagined. With the power of 3D rendering, IC will bring an Open World Sandboxed experienced to many players.

InfiniteCreations will give developers, or just interested individuals who would like to learn how to make 3D games, and mess around with objects in a 3d environment. IC will come with tons of tools and helpful API to get things done in the game. 

InfiniteCreations is a world of polygons. There's no models to import. In IC you can create customized shapes using vertex and indices. You can however mask textures onto objects. A game without color would be weird. You'll be able to control an object in-game and do alot of things you could ever imagine. Make custom game rooms for other people to join and play, or open sandbox worlds and get people to build the most amazing things while using IC API and it's Phyics!.

This is like minecraft on steriods. If this was minecraft, ever object would be a command block allowing you to write code, that will change the behavior of that object. This code is sent to server and verified and tested. Once done, all clients in the room object behavior will update instantly live.

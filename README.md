# InfiniteCreations

In a world of polygons, create, shape, script and build a world never imagined. With the power of 3D rendering, IC will bring an Open World Sandboxed experienced to many players.

InfiniteCreations will give developers, or just interested individuals who would like to learn how to make 3D games, and mess around with objects in a 3d environment. IC will come with tons of tools and helpful API to get things done in the game. 

InfiniteCreations is a world of polygons. There's no models to import. In IC you can create customized shapes using vertex and indices. You can however mask textures onto objects, as a game without color would be non interesting. You'll be able to control an object in-game and do alot of things you could ever imagine. Make custom game rooms for other people to join and play, or open sandbox worlds and get people to build the most amazing things while using IC API and it's Physics and GUI controls.

This is like minecraft on steriods. If this was minecraft, every object would be a command block allowing you to write code that will change the behavior of that object. This code is sent to server and verified and tested. Once done, all clients in the room object behavior will update instantly live. 

InfiniteCreations is not an engine or game. It is a huge extraordinary community of people who want to experience WebGL gaming, in a virtual world. You design your game within a skybox, and about everything in the game is interactive, including the sky. You can open your work publicly, or private. You have the role of an administration/owner. There will be default roles, and you can create your own roles. Without your object, you can define permissions for each role that is able to do a task. You have the power and tools to create your world as if you was Jesus himself. IC could also be refered as Roblox, however IC is taking a further step into being able to create a game easily. (Depending on your knowledge). When games are created with InfiniteCreations you can be able to publish it. Your game will then be approved, and posted onto our game hub. InfiniteCreations isn't just a game, but a world of game that we will even create. InfiniteCreations is the community.

- Roblox ( Roblox is a community of players, and developers who make worlds for others to enjoy. )
- Second Life ( Ability to spawn objects in game, and edit properties and write code to manipulate your object )
- Garrys Mod ( Ability to do things with objects using certain tools )
- Rust ( Building. Building is a feature, however lets not be exactly like minecraft. Ideally, you'll be able to connect blocks together many ways possbile. This may be a very complex system but hopefully it can be made)

Welcome to InfiniteCreations. It awaits.

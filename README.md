InfiniteCreations is a world of polygons. There's no models to import. In IC you can create customized shapes using vertex and indices. You can hover mask textures onto objects. A game without color would be weird. You'll be able to control an object in-game and do alot of things you could ever imagine. Make custom game rooms for other people to join and play, or open sandbox worlds and get people to build the most amazing things while using IC API and it's Phyics!.
